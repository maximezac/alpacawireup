- BUY 11.75916 CIBR @ $74.41 (~$875.00)
  - CDS=0.211 | TS=-0.046 | NS=0.597 | RSI=39.7 | SMA20=$76.30 | phase=early | size_k=0.35
  - Why: CDS only slightly above buy threshold; treat as a small probe. RSI is weak, indicating soft momentum. Momentum phase: early in a potential move. Final position size is scaled down to ~35% of the original plan.

- BUY 2.755533 BIIB @ $166.71 (~$459.37)
  - CDS=0.094 | TS=-0.212 | NS=0.552 | RSI=46.6 | SMA20=$154.43 | phase=mid | size_k=0.18 | guidance_k=0.70
  - Why: CDS only slightly above buy threshold; treat as a small probe. Price $166.71 is well above the 20-day SMA ($154.43), showing an extended push. Price is above the ideal dip level, so size is reduced to avoid chasing. Momentum phase: mid, in the body of the move. Final position size is scaled down to ~18% of the original plan.

  - CDS=-0.014 | TS=-0.412 | NS=0.585 | RSI=29.3 | SMA20=$38.01 | phase=mid | size_k=0.00
